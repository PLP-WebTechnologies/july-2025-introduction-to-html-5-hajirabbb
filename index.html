    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We believe that every girl has a voice that deserves to be heard and not suppressed. That's why we are here — to speak for the speechless.</p>

    <p>The girl child deserves a voice too, just like her male counterpart. People must know her for who she is and what she does. She should be allowed to live her life without fear or prejudice.</p>
